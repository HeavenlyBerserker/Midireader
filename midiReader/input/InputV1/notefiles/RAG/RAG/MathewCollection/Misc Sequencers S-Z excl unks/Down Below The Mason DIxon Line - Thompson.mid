"Down Below The Mason Dixon Line"   Words and music By Gary C. Thompson
<p>
<b>Verse:</b><br>

Well I packed my bags<br>
I'm going away<br>
I'm leavin' this town<br>
So far away<br>
I'm goin' down where<br> 
There isn't any snow__<br>
When I Hop aboard<br> 
That south bound train<br>
The folks here north<br>
Won't see me again<br>
When I get to the place<br>
I want to go__<br>
Oh gosh and golly gee<br>
There's just one place for me<br>
<p>
<b>Chorus:</b><br>

Down below the Mason Dixon Line<br>
The sun will shine<br>
around me<br>
All of the time<br>
I can smell that Honeysuckle vine<br>
I hear those banjos ringin'<br>
Folks all singin<br>
You don't know what joy they're bringing<br>
Hear that south land calling<br>
Oh gee it's calling me<br>
To Alabama, Caroline or sunny Tennesee<br>
Why don't you<br> 
Carry me back to ol' Virginny<br>
Down Below The Mason Dixon Line__<br>
(repeat Chorus)<br>
